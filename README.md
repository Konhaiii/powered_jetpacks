## Features
**Tiered Jetpacks:**\
You can craft 3 tiered jetpacks, all powered with E energy (produced using other tech mods). Each tier offers increased flight duration and speed, allowing for longer and faster aerial travel as you progress. You can equip them in the chest slot or the back slot from the Trinkets mod.

**HUD:**\
A text in the top left corner indicates the remaining power in your jetpack. This is useful if you don't plan on falling to your death.
